Transition Properties of CSS animations

This is the basic layout of a transition property in CSS:
.element{
  transition: [property] [duration] [ease] [delay];
}

We apply the transition to element 'element'
-Property: The property it's going to animate
-Duration: How long is the transition happening
-Ease: Or timing function... how is the transition distributed across time. Does it ease in...? Etc.
-Delay: How long should this wait before the animation starts happening

Example::
.element{
  transition: opacity 300ms ease-in-out 1s;
}
Opacity: The only thing that gets animated. Not height, width, etc.


You can even add multiple transitions:
.element{
  transition: [property1] [duration1] [ease1] [delay1], [property2] [duration2] [ease2] [delay2], ... ;
}

Not all properties are animatable but here is a link to which are http://oli.jp/2010/css-animatable-properties/

Animations take up resources. The best for performance are:
position:
scale:
rotation:
opacity:
